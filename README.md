### If you want to run this yourself follow these steps:

(Ensure you also have npm installed, if `ng serve` does not work run `npm install -g @angular/cli` then try again)

1. Clone the repo

2. cd into the frontend folder

3. run `npm i`

4. run `ng serve`

5. go to localhost:4200

### For grading the logic look at these files:

frontend > src > app > components > gantt-chart.component > gantt-chart.component.ts

This is where the main logic for the different schedular algorithms are

frontend > src > app > components > process-table.component > process-table.component.ts 

This is just the logic of constructing the process table


### AI Acknowledgement

I copied the same template code from DFA-web-app and made adjusstments to the data loading as needed and used AI for some styling and HTML


Standard logic checking while writing the algorithms
